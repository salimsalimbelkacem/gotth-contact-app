# watever
i don't want to justify what is this project and why, it is nothing for the moment,
only me trying out golang and htmx

# dependencies
first of all this is a golang project so you need to [install golang](https://go.dev/dl/) 

make sure that the path of binaries installed with go is set in your os environment variables,

## in windows
you can add the path inside `environment variables`

## in macos/ linux
depends on the shell you are using but here it is for the major ones
### bash
```bash
$ 

```
### zsh
```zsh
$ 

```
### fish
```fish
$ 

```
